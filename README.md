Hi.  

I have been tinkering with computers since BBSs were a thing and have worked since the 00s as a business leader and entreprenuer in healthcare IT.

I'm interested in all things DevSecOps, automation, and bridging disparate systems through integration tools and code.

This is nothing more than my public personal repository that contains a collection of "useful to me" stuff that might be helpful to you.  Who knows.
