Hi.  I have been tinkering with computers since BBSs were a thing and have worked in Health IT for the last 20 years.

I'm interested in all things DevSecOps, automation, and bridging disparate systems through integration tools and code.

This is nothing more than my public personal repository that contains a collection of useful to me stuff that might helpful to you.  Who knows.
